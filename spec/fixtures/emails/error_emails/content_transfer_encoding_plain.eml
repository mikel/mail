About the Company:

Youth And Amateur Sports Company Poised For Growth 

Intelligent Sports, Inc. is a publicly held company
trading on the OTC markets under the ticker symbol
ìIGTSî. Intelligent Sports will be the holding company
for several sports related businesses. Intelligent
Sports provides business units with strategic guidance
and support in the areas of marketing, sales,
sponsorships, partnerships, policy & procedures,
finance and expansion. Their initial business launch
is to develop youth and amateur sports centers
throughout the country that offers a year-round
sports calendar with emphasis on youth and amateur
sports programs and skill development. Their plan
is to expand this concept into membership-based,
multi-purpose sports facilities that will promote
a diverse range of sports programs, leagues,
tournaments, clinics, individual sports skill
development and nutritional training.

Fresh News:

UPLAND, Calif., Mar 22, 2005 (PRIMEZONE via COMTEX)
Participation fees for school sports programs
continues to escalate, at the same time record
obesity levels in children are being reported by
the Center for Disease Control. Intelligent Sports,
Inc. (Pink Sheets:IGTS) is working to do their part
to curb this alarming trend of by offering affordable
fitness centers to kids. 

"The time when school sports programs had enrollment
fees of $10 is fading," said former NBA star and
Intelligent Sports, Inc. board member, Reggie Theus.
"Not every parent is willing to pay $300 enrollment
fees for a sport their child is only casually
interested in; some parents can't afford to pay that
much for a sport their child excels at."

According to the President's Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports, only 17 percent of middle and
junior high schools and 2 percent of senior high
schools require daily physical activity for all
students. Hoping to fill the gap, The Sports Zone
by Intelligent Sports will support a wide range of
membership-based after-school sports programs,
weekend leagues and tournaments promoting individual
athletic skill development, the concepts of teamwork
and discipline, and a love of the game.

The Sports Zone opened in early October in Upland,
California. It encompasses a 10,000 square foot
facility featuring two basketball courts and caters
to court sports including basketball, volleyball,
cheerleading, and wrestling, and also has the ability
to host soccer, football and other field-related
athletic activity within the complex arena.
